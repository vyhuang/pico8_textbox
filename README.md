This is a bare-bones textbox implementation for [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). Part of its
implementation includes a 'printv' function which can be used to print custom
variable-width font, but this can be used by itself if desired.

The `test_printv.p8` and `test_tb.p8` files provide commented examples of how
to use this functionality.
